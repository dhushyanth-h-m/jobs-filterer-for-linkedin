# LinkedIn Jobs Filterer Chrome Extension

LinkedIn's "recommended jobs‚Äù and job search functionality are pretty
good at finding jobs you might be interested in, but unfortunately
they're pretty bad at finding *only* jobs you might be interested in,
i.e., they show you many jobs you don't care about. Furthermore,
although there are buttons you can click to supposedly tell LinkedIn
not to show you a particular job again, it frequently ignores this.

The code here implements a Chrome extension which allows you to
improve the quality of these lists of jobs by filtering out jobs you
don't want to see based on regular-expression matches on the job
title, company name, or location.

You can install this extension from the [Chrome Web Store][cws]. You
can also install it from the source code as described below.

Once you've installed the extension, open the options page for the
extension to configure it and see further instructions for how to use
it. There are four ways to open the options page for the extension:

1. Paste
   "`chrome-extension://afjdfegpgbfjgdelebopglhhfkjjblch/options.html`"
   into the URL bar in Chrome.

2. If you have the extension's icon pinned to your URL bar,
   right-click or ctrl-click on it and select "Options".

3. If you don't have the extension's icon pinned to your URL bar,
   click on the puzzle-piece icon to bring up the list of unpinned
   extensions, then click the three dots to the right of ths one and
   select "Options".

4. Paste "`chrome://settings`" into the URL bar, click the "Details"
   button for this extension, and then click the button to the right
   of "Extension options".

This extension was written by Jonathan Kamens. If you find this
extension useful, you can buy me a coffee [here][blog].
