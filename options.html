    <h2>What this extension does and how to use it</h2>

    <p>LinkedIn&rsquo;s &ldquo;recommended jobs&rdquo; and job search
      functionality are pretty good at finding jobs you might be
      interested in, but unfortunately they&rsquo;re pretty bad at
      finding <em>only</em> jobs you might be interested in, i.e., they
      show you many jobs you don&rsquo;t care about. Furthermore, although
      there are buttons you can click to supposedly tell LinkedIn not
      to show you a particular job again, it frequently ignores
      this.</p>

    <p>This extension&rsquo;s purpose is to allow you to improve the quality
      of these lists of jobs by filtering out jobs you don&rsquo;t want to
      see based on regular-expression matches on the job title,
      company name, or location.</p>

    <p>To use it, enter the regular expressions you want to filter
      with, one per line, in the text boxes above, then click
      Save. <em>Do not enclose your regular expressions in slashes</em>
      like you would if you were writing them in JavaScript.</p>

    <p>Documenting how to write regular expressions is beyond the
      scope of this help
      text; <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions"
               target="_blank">here</a>
      is one of the many online tutorials about this.</p>

    <p>Normally this extension will simulate clicking the button that
      tells LinkedIn not to show you the job again, but you will still
      see the job, greyed out, after it has done so. If you would like
      to hide filtered jobs completely, check the &ldquo;Hide filtered
      jobs completely&rdquo; checkbox (and remember to click the
      &ldquo;Save&rdquo; button).</p>
    
    <p>Note that the options are saved in synchronized storage, so if
      you have sync turned on in Chrome, the options are synchronized
      across all the Chrome profiles synchronizing via the same Google
      account.</p>
