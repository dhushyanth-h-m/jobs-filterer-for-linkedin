      <h2>NOTE: Granting the extension permissions on Firefox</h2>

      <p>This extension won't work on Firefox until you give it
        permission to access the content of linkedin.com web pages
        that you interact with. To do that, right-click (ctrl-click on
        macOS) on the extension icon in the toolbar, select
        &ldquo;Manage Extension&rdquo;, click
        &ldquo;Permissions&rdquo;, and turn on the switch next to
        &ldquo;Access your data for
        https://www.linkedin.com&rdquo;.</p>

    <h2>What LinkedIn Jobs Filterer does and how to use it</h2>

    <p>(See extension changelog <a href="changes.html">here</a>.)</p>

    <p>LinkedIn&rsquo;s &ldquo;recommended jobs&rdquo; and job search
      functionality are pretty good at finding jobs you might be
      interested in, but unfortunately they&rsquo;re pretty bad at
      finding <em>only</em> jobs you might be interested in, i.e., they
      show you many jobs you don&rsquo;t care about. Furthermore, although
      there are buttons you can click to supposedly tell LinkedIn not
      to show you a particular job again, it frequently ignores
      this.</p>

    <p>This extension&rsquo;s purpose is to allow you to improve the
      quality of these lists of jobs by filtering out jobs you
      don&rsquo;t want to see based on either jobs whose
      &ldquo;don&rsquo;t show me this&rdquo; button you&rsquo;ve
      clicked or on regular-expression (regexp) matches on the job
      title, company name, or location.</p>

    <p>The simplest way to use this extension is to tell LinkedIn not
      to show you jobs by clicking on their buttons intended for that
      purpose. LinkedIn won&rsquo;t necessarily obey that, but this
      extension will: it&rsquo;ll add the job&rsquo;s title, company
      name, and location to the &ldquo;Specific jobs&rdquo; list in
      the extension's <a href="options.html">options page</a> and save
      the options, and it&rsquo;ll be filtered out automatically from
      then on. You may want to revisit the
      <a href="options.html">options page</a> periodically and
      clear out old jobs from the list so that it doesn&rsquo;t get
      too long and slow things down. If you make a mistake and filter
      out a job you actually want to keep seeing, you can remove it
      from the list and click Save to undo the filtering.</p>

    <p>In addition to being able to click on LinkedIn's button for
      dismissing a job (the eye with a slash through it), this
      extension adds a second button next to it &mdash; a white funnel
      on a grey background, i.e., the extension's icon &mdash; which
      you can click on to tell the extension that you never want to
      see that job <em>without telling LinkedIn that</em>. Why would
      you want to do that? If a job is a relatively good fit for you
      but you still don't want to see it, e.g., because it's
      not <em>quite</em> right or because you've already applied to
      it, then you don't want to tell LinkedIn not to show it to you
      anymore, because that might train LinkedIn's algorithm to show
      you fewer jobs like that, which you don't want. Instead, just
      tell this extension to hide it whenever it comes up, so LinkedIn
      can keep popping it into your recommendations and search results
      but you'll never see it.</p>

    <p>In addition to filtering out specific jobs by clicking the
      buttons, you can filter jobs by regexp match. To do that, enter
      the regexp you want to filter with, one per line, in the text
      boxes on the <a href="options.html">options page</a>, then click
      Save. You can optionally enclose your regexp in slashes if you
      want to specify the case-insensitive flag on it; in other words,
      the regexp &ldquo;abc&rdquo; won't match &ldquo;Abc&rdquo;, but
      &ldquo;/abc/i&rdquo; will.</p>

    <p>Documenting how to write regexps is beyond the
      scope of this help
      text; <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions"
               target="_blank">here</a>
      is one of the many online tutorials about this.</p>

    <p>Normally this extension simulates clicking the buttons that
      tell LinkedIn not to show you jobs again, but you still
      see the jobs, greyed out, after it has done so. If you would like
      to hide filtered jobs completely, check the &ldquo;Hide filtered
      jobs completely&rdquo; checkbox (and remember to click the
      &ldquo;Save&rdquo; button).</p>
    
    <p>Note that the options are saved in synchronized storage, so if
      you have sync turned on, the options are synchronized
      across all synced browser profiles.</p>

    <h2>Example workflow</h2>

    <p>Note that you can open the <a href="options.html">options
      page</a> by clicking on the extension's icon. You'll probably
      want to pin the extension icon to your toolbar for easy
      access.</p>

    <p>A common workflow for this extension is to keep
      the <a href="options.html">options page</a> open in one browser
      Window while you have LinkedIn open in another window next to
      it. While reviewing a page of jobs, each time you come across
      one that could have been filtered out, update your filters
      appropriate in the extension options and Save the updated
      filters.</p>
