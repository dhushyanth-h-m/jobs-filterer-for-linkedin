    <h2>What LinkedIn Jobs Filterer does and how to use it</h2>

    <p>(See extension changelog <a href="changes.html">here</a>.)</p>

    <p>LinkedIn&rsquo;s &ldquo;recommended jobs&rdquo; and job search
      functionality are pretty good at finding jobs you might be
      interested in, but unfortunately they&rsquo;re pretty bad at
      finding <em>only</em> jobs you might be interested in, i.e., they
      show you many jobs you don&rsquo;t care about. Furthermore, although
      there are buttons you can click to supposedly tell LinkedIn not
      to show you a particular job again, it frequently ignores
      this.</p>

    <p>This extension&rsquo;s purpose is to allow you to improve the
      quality of these lists of jobs by filtering out jobs you
      don&rsquo;t want to see based on either jobs whose
      &ldquo;don&rsquo;t show me this&rdquo; button you&rsquo;ve
      clicked or on regular-expression matches on the job title,
      company name, or location.</p>

    <p>The simplest way to use this extension is to tell LinkedIn not
      to show you jobs by clicking on their buttons intended for that
      purpose. LinkedIn won&rsquo;t necessarily obey that, but this
      extension will: it&rsquo;ll add the job&rsquo;s title, company
      name, and location to the &ldquo;Specific jobs&rdquo; list
      above, and it&rsquo;ll be filtered out automatically from then
      on. You may want to revisit the <a href="options.html">options
      page</a> periodically and clear out old jobs from the list so
      that it doesn&rsquo;t get too long and slow things down. If you
      make a mistake and filter out a job you actually want to keep
      seeing, you can remove it from the list above and click the Save
      button to undo it.</p>

    <p>In addition to being able to click on LinkedIn's button for
      dismissing a job (the eye with a slash through it), this
      extension adds a second button next to it &mdash; a white funnel
      on a grey background, i.e., the extension's icon &mdash; which
      you can click on to tell the extension that you never want to
      see that job <em>without telling LinkedIn that</em>. Why would
      you want to do that? If a job is a relatively good fit for you
      but you still don't want to see it, e.g., because it's
      not <em>quite</em> right or because you've already applied to
      it, then you don't want to tell LinkedIn not to show it to you
      anymore, because that might train LinkedIn's algorithm to show
      you fewer jobs like that, which you don't want. Instead, just
      tell this extension to hide it whenever it comes up, so LinkedIn
      can keep popping it into your recommendations and search results
      but you'll never see it.</p>

    <p>In addition to filtering out specific jobs by clicking the
      buttons, you can filter jobs by regular expression match. To do
      that, enter the regular expressions you want to filter with, one
      per line, in the text boxes above, then click Save. <em>Do not
      enclose your regular expressions in slashes</em> like you would
      if you were writing them in JavaScript.</p>

    <p>Documenting how to write regular expressions is beyond the
      scope of this help
      text; <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions"
               target="_blank">here</a>
      is one of the many online tutorials about this.</p>

    <p>Normally this extension simulates clicking the buttons that
      tell LinkedIn not to show you jobs again, but you still
      see the jobs, greyed out, after it has done so. If you would like
      to hide filtered jobs completely, check the &ldquo;Hide filtered
      jobs completely&rdquo; checkbox (and remember to click the
      &ldquo;Save&rdquo; button).</p>
    
    <p>Note that the options are saved in synchronized storage, so if
      you have sync turned on in Chrome, the options are synchronized
      across all the Chrome profiles synchronizing via the same Google
      account.</p>

    <h2>Example workflow</h2>

    <p>If you&rsquo;re actively job-searching, you may wish to
      bookmark the <a href="options.html">options page</a> so you can
      reopen it easily.</p>

    <p>A common workflow for this extension is to keep
      the <a href="options.html">options page</a> open in one browser
      Window while you have LinkedIn open in another window next to
      it. While reviewing a page of jobs, each time you come across
      one that could have been filtered out, update your filters
      appropriate in the extension options and Save the updated
      filters.</p>
