      <h2>LinkedIn Jobs Filterer change history</h2>
      <h3>Version 0.4</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Fix automatic job filtering on click so that it works on
          the job search page; previously it only worked on the
          recommended jobs page.</li>
        <li>Add automatically filtered jobs to the list at the top
          instead of the bottom, i.e., the list is now newest jobs
          first, so if you have the options page opened when you hide
          a job you'll see it show up at the top of the list.</li>
        <li>When the user hides a job, check whether it would already
          be filtered out by the currently configured regular
          expressions (presumably because the user just edited them to
          exclude it), and if so, don't add it to the list of
          explicitly filtered jobs.</li>
        <li>Move the extension help to a separate page.</li>
        <li>Make changes to the "Hide filtered jobs completely"
          checkbox save immediately instead of waiting for the user to
          click the "Save" button.</li>
        <li>Add this changelog page and make it open on install/update.</li>
        <li>Implement some performance improvements.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Version 0.3</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Filter jobs automatically when the user clicks the
          hide button.</strong> You no longer have to edit regular
          expressions in the extension options to hide jobs. Now when
          you click the button to tell LinkedIn not to show you a job
          anymore (the eye with the slash through it), the extension
          remembers that automatically, and it subsequently hides the
          job reliably even if LinkedIn doesn't.</li>
        <li>Update the extension to accommodate changes in the format
          of LinkedIn's website code.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Version 0.2</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Add an example workflow to the documentation on the
          options page.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Version 0.1</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Initial release</li>
      </ul>
